# CyberMacro
"Cyber" is the fastest Dahood macro that I coded myself   Cyber (not unless we own) has the same function of using side mouse buttons and any keyboard inputs  while having a save settings feature, so every time you run it you don't have to retype the settings you want   click "Cyber" to download it via the link    Sorry for the inconvenience

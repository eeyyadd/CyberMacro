# CyberMacro
"Cyber" is the fastest Dahood macro that I coded myself   Cyber (not unless we own) has the same function of using side mouse buttons and any keyboard inputs  while having a save settings feature, so every time you run it you don't have to retype the settings you want   click "Cyber" to download it via the link    Sorry for the inconvenience|


Keep in mind Windows might flag it as a virus. The reason Windows is flagging the file as a potential virus is because it was made using a tool called PyInstaller. This tool is often used by developers to package programs into a single executable file, making them easier to run. Sometimes, antivirus software can mistakenly identify these packaged files as potential threats because they behave similarly to how viruses might act.

In reality, PyInstaller is just a tool that helps organize and distribute software more conveniently. It doesn't mean the file is harmful. It's like when your antivirus warns you about a file just because it looks suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean there's an actual virus inside. So, in this case, it's a false positive â€“ the file is safe, even though Windows is being cautious due to the way it was packaged.
